[![Weekly](https://github.com/pvnovarese/anchore-tools/actions/workflows/weekly.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/pvnovarese/anchore-tools/actions/workflows/weekly.yaml)

Small image with both anchorectl and anchore-cli.  This will become obsolete eventually as anchorectl will incorporate all of anchore-cli's functionality.

You can pull the image from docker hub: docker.io/pvnovarese/anchore-tools:main
